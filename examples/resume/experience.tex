        \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bullet}
        \item {Set up a pipeline to automatically crawl, parse and embed data to keep chatbot up to date.}
        \item {Set up CI/CD using Azure Pipelines and Docker Swarm.}
        \item {Developed miscellaneous front-end features with Angular.}

        \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bullet}
        \item {Set up web-based visualization of SUMO simulations, including various performance improvements such as visual clustering
        of vehicles, frame dropping, and intelligent memory management to avoid buffering.}
        \item {Dockerized QarSUMO and created an API to access it to ease deployment and scalability.}

        \item {\hspace{-3.0mm}\underline{{SIHA}}}
        \renewcommand{\labelitemi}{\bullet}
        \item {Refactored stale flutter code for SIHA mobile app, including migration to null-safety and BLOC architecture pattern.}
        \item {Developed new Team Competitions feature, which included the design of DB models, implementation of Flutter screens,
        API endpoints, and background services to log leaderboards and update user points when a competition ends.}
        \item {Implemented a YAML specification for TASRIF that converts YAML to python code to make TASRIF more accessible to users
        with less coding familiarity.}
        \item {Created an on-premise deployment script for SIHA that pulls all the relevant images from MS azure. This removes the need
        to manually pull images and leaves no sensitive code at the deployment site.}
        \item {Mentored 2 batches of interns over a 3 month period each.}

        \item {Worked with Professor Ihab Younis, filling computational biology support for various projects and students under the lab.}
        \item {Built a dashboard for visualizing data generated from breast cancer databases using React, NodeJS and MongoDB. The
        dashboard was part of a deliverable for the lab’s research grant.}
        \item {Compiled a database on Minor Intron Containing Genes (MIGs) to help investigate their role in regulating oncogenes. This
        includes computational prediction of how minor intron retention impacts protein synthesis using an automated process
        which generated reliable data, as opposed to traditional biology methods which are error-prone and time-consuming.}
        \item {Developed an RNA-Seq pipeline using Nextflow that performs read alignment, mapping, and calculates gene abundance for
        analyzing lab-generated data.}
